How brave of you hero, to face me head on you must think yourself capable.
I must say I admair you bravary as foolish as it is. Therefore I shall let you make the first move.
Big mistake hero. Now you Die!
You think your self strong hero.
Light on your feet you are.
Malakar: It seems you have exhuasted all your magic power
How disapointing, just when I was starting to have fun
I'll make your death quit false hero!!
Malakar: It has been so long since I'v taken such pleasure in a fight.
You are truly a formibale fighter, however I must warn you hero
For my kin posses power far greater then mine and there is no questioning that they will reveng my death...
How confident of you
Your ego will be your undoing
